veiljs
======

VeilJS is slated to become the small library for overlays and dialogues that 
integrates easily into your project.

It assumes as little as possible about your markup, styling and frontend code. 
Whether you want to use it with Zurb Foundation or Bootstrap, wrap it in a 
Knockout binding or an Angular Directive, or swap out jQuery with Zepto through 
requireJS â€” Veil is built with these requirements in mind.
